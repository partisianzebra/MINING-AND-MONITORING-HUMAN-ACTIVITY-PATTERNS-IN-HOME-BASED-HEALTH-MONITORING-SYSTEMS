# MINING-AND-MONITORING-HUMAN-ACTIVITY-PATTERNS-IN-HOME-BASED-HEALTH-MONITORING-SYSTEMS
In this project, I present a fully automated approach by discovering natural activity patterns and their variations in real-life data. I enhanced the paper suggestion to our family and alert message sending to our relative/family based on discovering and tracking and Monitoring Human Activity patterns of daily activities from smart meters.This project mainly focus on the suggestion technique. It represent for the real time activity into our family and relatives. The results of identifying human activity patterns from appliance usage are presented in details in this project along with accuracy. The highest level of evidence found was in a study that supported smart homes and home health monitoring technologies for use in monitoring activities of daily living, mental health, and heart conditions in older adults with complex needs. This means we can efficiently train the system and increase the accuracy of detecting human activities.
